### No scoped styles

Instead, give the component's base element a class and use that instead.

```html
<!-- ✔ GOOD -->
<template>
  <div class="component">
  </div>
</template>

<style>
.component {}
</style>

 <!-- ✘ BAD -->
<style scoped>
.component {}
</style>

### FAQ (not logged in)

**How do I log in?**

Welcome! Easily log in by entering the e-mail address and password you created when signing up. If you have not signed up for an account yet, click the “Sign Up” button.

**What if I lost or can’t remember my password?**

No worries. Click “lost password,” and a temporary new password will be sent to your e-mail.

**What if I didn’t receive my lost password email?**

Contact us below and let us know your full name, the e-mail address you registered the account under, and the school’s name. We will be happy to reset your password for you.

**How do I change my password?**

After logging in, click the “Profile” link under your name—it’s located in the upper left part of the page. Click the “Change Password” button, and you’ll have the option to change your password. Pick a fun one!

**As a sponsor, how can I make a pledge for a student?**

That’s an easy one. You will just need the student’s Public Pledge Link, which can be found on the student’s dashboard. The parent/guardian who registered the student can give you the link. And thank you for your generosity!

**How do I edit/delete a pledge?**

If you are a sponsor, navigate to the link included in the confirmation e-mail you received right after making your pledge. If you did not receive this e-mail, please contact us below and let us know the name of the student and school you sponsored.
If you are a parent, log into your account and click on the “My Pledges” tab. Click the “Edit” button next to the pledge you wish to change.
Please note that you cannot edit/delete pledges after the event has completed. If you still want to make changes to a pledge, contact us below and let us know the pledge you’d like to edit. We’re happy to help you.

**How do I pay online?**

If your school is set up with an online payment option, please include an email address with your pledge. Sponsors will get a payment email at the time of their pledge and a reminder email once the event is completed. Please make sure to check your spam and junk folders, just in case.
If you are a sponsor and did not receive these e-mails, please contact us below and let us know the name of the student and school you sponsored. We can then provide you with your link to easily pay online.

**Why is the option to pay online not showing up on my account?**

Schools also have the option to not accept online payments. If you have any questions about being able to pay online, contact us below. We can check to see if the school is accepting online payments.

**How do I pay online if I live outside the country?**

Don’t worry, world; you’re covered. Our online payment system accepts any Visa or Mastercard, even if you have an international address. The address fields can be left blank if they do not apply to you.

**What is the payment process?**

After the event, students will be sent home with a collection envelope and letter to help collect and turn in any cash or check payments from sponsors. Please send all cash and check payments to the school in this collection envelope. If your school is set up with an online payment option, sponsors can pay online instead of sending in cash or check.
Sponsors who entered a valid email address with their pledges will also receive an email once the pledge is submitted and another reminder email the evening after the event with payment instructions. Sponsors should check their junk folder for the payment email if they have not received it. Also, please note that some email servers occasionally block these payment emails, so please communicate payment information to your sponsors.
If sponsors choose to send check or cash directly to the school, please have them write on the check memo line: the student’s name and the grade, as well as our program—Boosterthon. Please do the same on a note for all cash payments as well. Remember, please do not make checks out to Boosterthon.

## FAQ/Help Desk Pages - Logged In

The FAQ Pages are questions and answers that parents and/or sponsors may potentially have and can access on their own without reaching out to customer support. The Help Desk is a way for parents and/or sponsors to reach out to customer support for specific questions, which will be replied back via Zendesk.

### Business Logic/Functionality

The “Your Name” and the “Your Email” fields will prefill the Parent first and last name and the Parent email address. 
No other fields are pre-selected or filled.

### FAQ (logged in)

**How do I edit/delete a pledge?**

Simply go to "My Pledges" and click the yellow “Edit” button next to the owner of the pledge. Once the event is over, this editing option is no longer available. But if you would still like to make changes to a pledge, please contact our friendly Help Desk.. (We can’t wait to help you :)

**What is the difference between pledge per lap and flat donation?**

A pledged per lap amount will be multiplied by the number of laps the student will complete at the event (about 30 to 35 laps, with a lap max of 35).
Example: If the sponsor makes a $1 pledge per lap and the student completes 30 laps, the sponsor donates $30 to the school. A flat donation is a gift that is not determined by the number of laps the student completes.

**How are prizes awarded?**

Rewards are given out based on the pledged per lap total of the student, but flat donations count too. $30 in flat donations equals $1 pledge per lap on the prize scale.
Example: Students will reach the first prize level with a $1 pledge per lap or $30 in flat donations. Plus, all additional pledges recorded online continue to add up to reach higher Fitness Reward levels.

**Do flat donations get rewarded?**

Absolutely. Every $30 in flat donations is equal to $1 pledged per lap, since 30 laps is the average number of laps students typically complete. For example, $90 dollars donated is equal to $3 dollars pledged per lap and is credited to the reward scale as $3.

**What is family pledging?**

Family Pledging is a new feature on FunRun.com that allows parents with multiple children at a school to combine their students’ profiles into one profile. Sponsors can now pledge every student in a family with one click, saving time and processing fees.

**As a parent, how do I activate it?**

- If you only have one student in the program, Family Pledging will not affect you.
- If you have more than one student, you’ll be given the option to turn it ON or OFF when you register your students on FunRun.com. Please note: Family Pledging will be turned ON by default.

**Will Family Pledging work if my students are in two programs (Elementary/Middle School)?**

Unfortunately, no. Family Pledging will be turned on for BOTH programs, but parents who have a student in two programs (i.e. a 4th grader and a 7th grader) will not be able to combine their profiles. This is something we’re looking into for the future.

**Can sponsors pledge each student in a family a different amount?**

Not exactly. When Family Pledging is ON, sponsors choose the size of their pledge (i.e. $1 Per Lap). That means they’re pledging that amount for ALL of the students in that particular family. For example, if Grandma clicks $1 pledge per lap, it means she is donating $30-$35 for ALL three grandkids. In that case, her total would be $90-$105.

**Can I pledge students individually if Family Pledging is ON?**

Unfortunately, no. To pledge students individually, Family Pledging will need to be turned off. (See previous question.)

**Will I see multiple emails and charges for a pledge when Family Pledging is on?**

Nope! You’ll receive a single email and a single charge for the pledge.

**As a parent, how do I turn off Family Pledging for my kids?**

To turn off Family Pledging, go to the Home Dashboard and click “Edit” on any of the profiles (with the exception of a teacher profile). From there, you can toggle the Family Pledging tab to Off.

**What is a “Pending Pledge”?**

Some pledges are marked as pending because our team needs to confirm with sponsors or parents about their large pledge amount. This helps ensure there are only fun “surprises” at the end of the program. The friendly Booster Team will contact parents and sponsors via phone or email to confirm pending pledges.

**Why has my child not received his or her prize(s) yet?**

Your student might have pending pledges. (see "What is a Pending Pledge?") Once the pledge is confirmed, your student will receive their prizes. A friendly Booster Team member will reach out to you.

**I can’t add more pledges. Why not?**

In most cases, the deadline to enter pledges is the day after the event, at 7:30 am, unless communicated differently. But if you’d like, you can send in any extra donations to the school even if the pledges were not entered into the system.

**When is the pledge money due?**

Please check the FAQs on the participant's page for your specific due date.

**Who do I make checks out to?**

For [Student First Name], make checks payable to: [Program Name].
Please do not make checks out to Boosterthon.

**How do I pay online?**

If your school is set up with an online payment option, please include an email address with your pledge. Sponsors will get a payment email at the time of their pledge and a reminder email once the event is completed. Please make sure to check your spam and junk folders, just in case.

**How do I pay online if I live outside the country?**

Don’t worry, world; you’re covered. Our online payment system accepts any Visa or Mastercard, even if you have an international address. The address fields can be left blank if they do not apply to you.

**What is the payment process?**

After the event, students will be sent home with a collection envelope and letter to help collect and turn in any cash or check payments from sponsors. Please send all cash and check payments to the school in this collection envelope. If your school is set up with an online payment option, sponsors can pay online instead of sending in cash or check. Sponsors who entered a valid email address with their pledges will also receive an email once the pledge is submitted and another reminder email the evening after the event with payment instructions. Sponsors should check their junk folder for the payment email if they have not received it. Also, please note that some email servers occasionally block these payment emails, so please communicate payment information to your sponsors. If sponsors choose to send check or cash directly to the school, please have them write on the check memo line: the student’s name and the grade, as well as our program—Boosterthon. Please do the same on a note for all cash payments as well. Remember, please do not make checks out to Boosterthon.

**Why is my payment not showing up?**

Payments are entered into the system on the first due date, about one week after the Salesforce Test Elementary Fun Run is complete. If you submitted your payment after the due date, please allow 3-5 business days for the payment to be added to your account.

**Why will my online payment not go through?**

There are several reasons, so try these helpful steps:

1. Double check to make sure you are entering the billing information exactly as it is on the card account.
2. Try using a different Internet browser, especially if you’re using Safari. Try using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. They tend to work best.
3. Try using a different computer or mobile device to access our site and submit your payment.

**Is my pledge tax deductible and do you give any receipts?**

It’s likely your donation is tax deductible. It all depends on your school’s tax exemption status. So, please double check with your school or parent organization to verify if they are tax exempt. If your school has an online payment option and you pay online, a receipt will be emailed to the email on file afterward. For cash and check payments, most schools do not write receipts, but please contact your school to verify if they do or do not provide receipts. For contributions less than $250, a cancelled check or a bank record is sufficient documentation. And remember to hug your local accountant. Taxes are complicated.

**Why does the website not show “paid” when I have paid?**

Only if you paid for a pledge online will the pledge be marked as “paid.” If you pay by cash or check, you will need to verify your payment on the participant dashboard after the event.

# #Pledge Process (Step 3)

The third step of the pledge process is where the user has the option to either pay for the pledge online at that moment or pay later. There is various functionality that affects this page and the two options that appear.

- Business Logic/Case:
- Pay Online Now and Pay Later buttons that the user can switch between; by clicking the Pay Online Now button, the user will be able to enter their credit card information and submit a payment for the pledge immediately. If the user clicks the Pay Later button, the credit card fields disappear and they can submit the pledge and pay for it later.
- The following settings can be configured in Locker
    - If Online Payments is enabled, Pay Online Now will appear as an option during the pledge process; if Online Payments isn’t enabled, the option will not appear during the pledge process
    - If Online Payments Required is enabled, ONLY Pay Online Now will appear as an option during the pledge process
    - If Promote Pay Online Now is enabled, the Pay Online Now option will appear as the only clickable button, with a hyperlink below it saying “Or, Pay Later”, which, when clicked, will result in Pay Later being the only clickable button with a hyperlink below stating, “Or, Pay Online Now”, which can be switched back to the default on click
    - If the Sponsor Convenience Fee is added, it will show up in the Payment Total box and be added to the total price of the pledge
    - If the School Processing Fee AND Online Processing Fee are both added, then the user will see the additional amount in the Payment Total box with a checkbox by it allowing the user to opt in or out of paying the processing fee.
- The ability to select the ‘State’ when filling out information to a credit card will be disabled when any country, besides the U.S., is selected.

## Pay Online Pledges Now

The Pay Online Pledges page has several functions, it may serve as a window for sponsors and parents to see what pledges their students has and what status they are in. You may also pay for any outstanding pledges at the “confirmed” status. The pledges are ordered from oldest to newest. We display the sponsor’s name, the participant they pledged, the pledge they made, and the estimated totals.

- Business Logic/Functionality
  - The Pay Online Button will not display for the user if there are no pledges to be paid.

## Public Dashboard

The public dashboard serves as a means for sponsors to pledge participants.

- Business Logic/Functionality
  - When Family Pledging is ON:

Multiple student names will appear in the upper left-hand box

In the upper left-hand box, the students’ profile pictures will cycle through every few seconds

Multiple Student Star videos will appear on the page corresponding to each student that has uploaded a profile picture

Under Current Pledges, the various students’ pledges will appear ranked from highest at the top, to lowest at the bottom

Family Pledging logo is on the top right corner of the “SHARE YOUR PLEDGE PAGE” box

The My Goal bar is a cumulative amount of all the participants’ in the family
    - When Family Pledging is OFF:

Just the student’s, whose public dashboard you’re on, name and profile picture will appear in the upper left-hand box

Under Current Pledges, only the student’s, whose public dashboard you’re on, pledges will appear ranked from highest at the top, to lowest at the bottom

Family Pledging logo is NOT PRESENT on the top right corner of the “SHARE YOUR PLEDGE PAGE” box

The My Goal bar is just the goal and progress amount of the one participant selected
    - If a participant has already met their goal, “My Goal” and its accompanying progress bar will not show up; it is only visible when the participant hasn’t met their goal yet.
    - The Business Leaderboard features all of the Business pledges in the program, regardless of parent account or family, ranked from highest to lowest. The 6th highest pledge and lower are hidden under a collapsible tab that can be expanded by clicking the hyperlink “Show More”, which changes to “Show Less” that will collapse the tab when clicked

## Registration Page

This page can be reached from the student’s dashboard and is the primary way that parents and teachers may register their students. A code is given to Teachers they may use to register themselves which is unique to them as it displays the Fun-Run dashboard pages differently. Parents are also given a code which is unique and will modify the way the pages display as well.

- Business Logic/Functionality
  - No Special Considerations

## Registration Page - Register Participant

This is the 2nd page of the registration process. On this page the parent or teacher is asked for the first and last name of the student along with what class they are in. In order to reduce confusion we do ask if the person registering the participant is the parent or guardian.

- Business Logic/Functionality:
    - If the person registering the participant is not the parent/guardian we assume they will de-select the “I am this student’s parent/guardian” checkbox which will not allow them to create the student in the database.
    - If the account has more than one participant already registered then the parent or teacher is asked if they would like to enable family pledging On/Off.
    - Every parent/teacher must accept the participation agreement waiver.

## Rewards Page

The rewards page allows sponsors or parents to examine the prizes Boosterthon offers and what prizes the student has earned. This page contains information related to prizes such as the donation amounts necessary to unlock a prize, prize videos, and the current status of your total pledges.

-Business Logic/Functionality

    - Each prize has a tier that unlocks once the pledge total amounts reach that value.
    - Pending pledges are not counted towards the amounts needed to unlock prizes.
    - Unit Type will change based upon the selection at the program level.
    - PPLs are converted using the formula (1)PPL * 30 = 30$.
    - Visually the prizes are at the red color status until the pledge amounts are reached after-which they will switch to a green color
    - If the pledges are “pending” then the prize box will become yellow instead of green once the prize totals threshold is reached.

- Data Points:
