 [*] AutoLogin
 [~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 [~] Description:
It looks for the login form in the user provided URL, merges its input fields
with the user supplied parameters and sets the cookies of the response and
request as framework-wide cookies.

**NOTICE**: If the login form is by default hidden and requires a sequence of DOM
interactions in order to become visible, this plugin will not be able to submit it.
