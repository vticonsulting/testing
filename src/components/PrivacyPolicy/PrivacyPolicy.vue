      We at Booster value the trust our fun run participants place in our
      company. We take reasonable steps to safeguard that trust by
      implementing measures aimed at keeping nonpublic personal information
      about fun run participants in a secure environment, and by using
      that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We gather
      only the information that we need to administer our business, our
      security and the security of our fun run participants in order to
      provide superior products and service. We do not typically share
      such information with third parties except as necessary to provide
      services to our visitors and for the other specific purposes described
      below.
    </p>
    <h4>Visiting Our Website</h4>
    <p>
      You can visit the Booster website ("Website") without identifying
      yourself or revealing any personal information. We collect and
      monitor user traffic patterns throughout the Website according to
      non-personally identifiable information such as a user's domain
      name, IP address, browser type, date and time of access and pages
      viewed. This non-personally identifiable information is collected
      in order to measure the number of visitors to our Website and to
      determine which areas of the Website receive the most traffic.
    </p>
    <h4>Children Online Privacy Protection</h4>
    <p>
      Our website is intended to be used by Parents/Guardians of fun run
      participants and sponsors over the age of 13.
      By completing the registration process, you are agreeing
      that you are over the age of 13. We never ask for a child's contact information.
      Any personal information of students (name, gender, picture, or personal message)
      can only be entered by a registered Parent/Guardian.
    </p>
    <h4>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>How We Collect Information. </strong> Most information comes
      directly from the Parents/Guardians of fun run participants when they
      access and use our Internet services ("Services").
      When we use the term "Business Information" in this privacy policy,
      we mean information that tells us specifically who a visitor is
      and their contact information, including their
      name, email address, street address and telephone number. We collect
      Business Information when a guardian/representative of a fun run
      participant uses our Services or provides information at our events.
      Visitors to our Website may also provide Business Information and
      other data by pledging money towards a fun run participant. A guardian/representative
      can access their contacts via the Google permissions API if desired. We
      have taken steps to protect the Business Information of our online
      users by utilizing 256-bit SSL encryption to help ensure information
      is secured from unauthorized users, and we protect URI data through
      encrypted variables so that end users cannot read data in the address
      bar of their browser.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How We Use Information.</strong> We do not rent, lease or sell
      Business Information or Google or Gmail information or contacts to any marketeer.
      All data and contacts transmitted by the Google API and usage information is never
      provided to other visitors or third party websites. If you have any questions
      concerning Google, please visit the link below for further information:

      We may share Business Information or other data collected from visitors
      with our business associates, including unaffiliated third parties
      who assist us in administering the Services. We may use, share or transfer
      Business Information or other data collected from visitors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to provide enhanced services;</li>
      <li>to resolve disputes;</li>
      <li>to solicit feedback from fun run participants, including potential participation in focus groups to assist in improving services;</li>
      <li>to maintain and service our systems;</li>
      <li>to protect the confidentiality or security of fun run participant's records;</li>
      <li>to law enforcement or other government officials to protect Booster or any fun run participants, or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of possible unlawful activity;</li>
      <li>in connection with a sale or merger of Booster;</li>
      <li>to recipients of any fund pledges;</li>
      <li>to our attorneys, accountants and regulators;</li>
      <li>or for other legally permissible purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If fun run participants or their parent/legal guardian (if child
      is less than 13 years old) opt to allow us to use or share Business
      Information and other data with trusted affiliates, independent
      contractors and other businesses for marketing and business purposes,
      we may choose to do so. Fun run participants are provided with an
      "access code" to input and view personal information. Should a fun
      run participant choose to give this access code to any third party,
      for whatever reason, Booster is not responsible for any information
      obtained by such third party; provided, however, that fun run
      participant information cannot be viewed or edited by the user once
      it has been submitted even if an access code is entered by an
      unauthorized user.

      discloses information to other parties, then different rules may
