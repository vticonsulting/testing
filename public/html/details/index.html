          <p>
            There are many different elements that HTML provides that convey
            meaning to a document.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;form&gt; for example is a semantic element that will mark that
            the contents inside of it as an interactive form. The browser and
            the user know what the content should be like here.
          </p>
          <p>
            &lt;div&gt; for example is <em>not</em> a semantic element. It has
            no implied meaning and is used as a generic container when other
            elements are unsuitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing semantic HTML requires developers to make use of as many
            correct semantic elements as possible to make sure the document
            outline can be understood without having to see it on screen.

      <section>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This element would be used when information you want available to the
          user should be able to be hidden. Typically this would be for an FAQ
          section or longer content separate from the main body of the text.
        </p>

        <p>
          While <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> is the container, the interactive
          part comes from the content of the
          <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. This acts as a title as well as
          a handle to open and close the content.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> elements are a great way to be able to
          toggle content without having to rely on JavaScript.
